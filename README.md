## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm a Reverse Engineer

Passionate about dissecting and understanding the inner workings of software and systems. I thrive on the challenge of unraveling complex code and uncovering hidden functionalities.

### What I'm Currently Exploring

* Delving deeper into [mention a specific area of reverse engineering you're currently focused on, e.g., binary exploitation techniques, analyzing embedded firmware, understanding malware behavior].
* Experimenting with [mention a specific tool or technology you're learning or using, e.g., advanced Ghidra scripting, fuzzing techniques with AFL++, creating custom IDA Pro plugins].
* Applying my programming skills in **C++, C#, and C** to develop tools and scripts for analysis and automation.
* Exploring the possibilities of building user interfaces for reverse engineering tools with **Svelte**.

### Skills

* **Reverse Engineering:** Binary Analysis, Disassembly (IDA Pro, Ghidra, Binary Ninja), Debugging (GDB, WinDbg), Dynamic Analysis, Static Analysis, Vulnerability Research.
* **Programming Languages:** C++, C, C#, Python (likely used for scripting!), Svelte.
* **Operating Systems:** Windows, Linux.
* **Other Relevant Skills:** [Mention any other relevant skills, e.g., Assembly (various architectures), Network Analysis, Cryptography basics].

### Projects & Contributions

* **[Project Title 1]:** [Briefly describe a personal reverse engineering project. If it's open-source, link to the repository. E.g., "A collection of Python scripts for automating common malware analysis tasks. [Link to Repo]"]
* **[Project Title 2]:** [Briefly describe another project or contribution. E.g., "Contribution to [Open Source Project Name] by implementing [feature or fix]. [Link to Contribution/Repo]"]
* [Consider mentioning smaller scripts or tools you've developed if you don't have large projects.]
